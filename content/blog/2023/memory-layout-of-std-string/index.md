For a professional C++ developer, it's important to understand memory organization of the data
structures, especially when it comes to the containers from the C++ Standard Library. In this post
of Tasty C++ series we'll look inside of `std::string`, so that you can more effectively work with
C++ strings and take advantage and avoid pitfalls of the C++ Standard Library you are using.

In C++ Standard Library, `std::string` is one of the three
[contiguous containers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousContainer) (together
with `std::array` and `std::vector`). This means that a sequence of characters is stored in a
_contiguous_ area of the memory and an individual character can be efficiently accessed by its index
at O(1) time. The C++ Standard imposes more requirements on the complexity of string operations,
which we will briefly focus on later in this post.

If we are talking about the C++ Standard, it's important to remember that it doesn't impose exact
implementation of `std::string`, nor does it specify the exact size of `std::string`. In practice,
as we'll see, the most popular implementations of the C++ Standard Library allocate 24 or 32 bytes
for the same `std::string` object (excluding the data buffer). On top of that, the memory layout of
string objects is also different, which is a result of a tradeoff between optimal memory and CPU
utilization, as we'll also see below.

## Long Strings

For people just starting to work with strings in C++, `std::string` is usually associated with three
data fields:

- **Buffer** – the buffer where string characters are stored, allocated on the heap.
- **Size** – the current number of characters in the string.
- **Capacity** – the max number of character the buffer can fit, a size of the buffer.

Talking C++ language, this picture could be expressed as the following class:

```cpp
class TastyString {
    char *    m_buffer;     //  string characters
    size_t    m_size;       //  number of characters
    size_t    m_capacity;   //  m_buffer size
}
```

This representation takes _24 bytes_ and is very close to the production code.

Let's see how this compares to the **actual size** of `std::string`. This is given by
`sizeof(std::string)` and in the most popular implementations of the C++ Standard Library is the
following:

| C++ Standard Library                                | Size of std::string() |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [MSVC STL](https://github.com/microsoft/STL)        | 32 bytes              |
| [GCC libstdc++](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Libstdc++) | 32 bytes              |
| [LLVM libc++](https://libcxx.llvm.org/)             | 24 bytes              |

What a surprise, only **LLVM** allocates expected **24 bytes** for `std::string`. The other two,
**MSVC** and **GCC**, allocate **32 bytes** for the same string. (Numbers in the table are for -O3
optimization. Note that MSVC allocates 40 bytes for `std::string` in the _debug mode_.)

Let's get some intuition about why various implementation allocate different amount of memory for
the same object.

<!-- Is this information optimal to represent a string ?

In fact, the _capacity_ is not required. We can use _size_ and _buffer_ only, but when the string
grows, a new buffer should be allocated on the heap (because we can't tell how many extra characters
the current buffer can fit). Since heap allocation is slow, such allocations are avoided by tracking
the buffer capacity.

The _buffer_ is a [null terminated string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string)
well known in C.

`TastyString` occupies 24 bytes, which is only 3x more than **fundamental types** such as `void *`,
`size_t`, or `double`. This means that `TastyString` is cheap to copy or pass by value as a function
argument. What is not cheap, however, is (1) copying the buffer, especially when the string is long,
and (2) allocating a buffer for a new, even small, copy of the string. -->

## Small Strings

You have already noticed that the fields of `TastyString` and `std::string` contain only the
_auxiliary data_, while the _actual data_ (characters) is stored in the buffer allocated on the
heap. However, when the actual data is small enough, it seems inefficient to reserve 24 or 32 bytes
for the auxiliary data, isn't it?

**Small String Optimization.** This is what the _small string optimization_ (aka SSO) is used for.
The idea is to store the actual data in the auxiliary region with no need to allocate the buffer on
the heap, that makes `std::string` cheap to copy and construct (as it's only 3x-4x times more than
fundamental types such as `void *`, `size_t`, or `double`). This technique is popular among various
implementations, but is not a part of the C++ Standard.

Now it makes sense why some implementations increase the auxiliary region to 32 bytes --- to store
longer _small strings_ in the auxiliary region before switching into the regular mode with
dynamically allocated buffer.

**How big are small strings?** Let's see how many characters the auxiliary region can store. This is
what `std::string().capacity()` will tell us:

| C++ Standard Library | Small String Capacity |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| MSVC STL             | 15 chars              |
| GCC libstdc++        | 15 chars              |
| LLVM libc++          | 22 chars              |

Another surprise: LLVM with its 24 bytes for `std::string` fits more characters than MSVC or GCC
with their 32 bytes. (In fact, it's possible to fully utilize the auxiliary region, so that n-byte
area fits n-1 chars and `'\0'`. Watch
[CppCon 2016 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPR8h4-qZdk) for details.)

**How fast are small strings?** As with many things in programming, there is a tradeoff between
memory utilization and code complexity. In other words, the more characters we want to squeeze into
the auxiliary memory, the more _complex logic_ we should invent. This results not only in more
assembly operations, but also into branching that is not good for CPU pipelines.

To illustrate this point, let's see what the most commonly used `size()` method compiles to in
various standard libraries:

**GCC stdlibc++**. The function directly copies `m_size` field into the output register (see
<https://godbolt.org/z/7nYe9rWdE>):

| Example                                      | GCC libstdc++                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ![string size C++ code](string-size-src.png) | ![string size GCC assembler](string-size-gcc.png) |

**LLVM libc++**. The function at first checks if the string is short and then calculates its size
(see <https://godbolt.org/z/xM349cG5P>).

| Example                                      | LLVM libc++                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ![string size C++ code](string-size-src.png) | ![string size LLVM assembler](string-size-llvm.png) |

LLVM code remains more complex for other methods too. It's hard to say how badly this impacts the
overall performance. The best advice is to keep this knowledge at hand and, for your particular use
case, benchmark and experiment with various implementations.

## Memory Allocation Policy

Finally, let's come back to a long string mode and see how `m_buffer` grows when our string becomes
bigger. Some
[comments](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/basic_string.tcc#L142)
in the GCC source code, refer to the _exponential growth policy_. It's not clear if this is an
internal GCC decision or part of the C++ Standard. In any case, all three implementations use
exponential growth, so that **MSVC** has **1.5x factor** growth, while **GCC** and **LLVM** use **2x
factor**.

The code below illustrates the growth algorithm in each implementation. The capacity examples show
how the capacity changes as the string grows one character at a time in a loop:

- **MSVC STL**

  ```cpp
  size_t newCapacity(size_t newSize, size_t oldCap) {
      return max(newSize, oldCap + oldCap / 2);
  }
  ```

  Capacity growth: 15, 31, 47, 70, 105, 157, 235, 352, 528, 792, 1'188, 1'782.

- **GCC libstdc++**

  ```cpp
  size_t newCapacity(size_t newSize, size_t oldCap) {
      return max(newSize + 1, 2 * oldCap);
  }
  ```

  Capacity growth: 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 960, 1'920, 3'840, 7'680, 15'360.

- **LLVM libc++**

  ```cpp
  size_t newCapacity(size_t newSize, size_t oldCap) {
      return max(newSize, 2 * oldCap) + 1;
  }
  ```

  Capacity growth: 22, 47, 95, 191, 383, 767, 1'535, 3'071, 6'143, 12'287.

## Tha Last Word

The actual implementation of `std::string` varies among the most popular implementations of the C++
Standard Library. The main difference is in the Small String Optimization, which the C++ Standard
doesn't define explicitly.

The following table summarizes some key facts about `std::string`:

| C++ Standard Library | String Size | Small String Capacity | Growth Factor |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| MSVC STL             | 32 bytes    | 15 chars              | 1.5x          |
| GCC libstdc++        | 32 bytes    | 15 chars              | 2x            |
| LLVM libc++          | 24 bytes    | 22 chars              | 2x            |

These details will be useful for every professional C++ developer. They are especially important
when optimizing for CPU and memory efficiency.

For sure, I'm not the only one curious about how strings are implemented in **other languages**.
